## Inspiration
Fascinated by the beings that roamed this Earth million of years ago and dismayed by the lack of due interest. We present you- Dinocord!

## What it does

Dinocord is a discord bot for aspiring paleontologists and pre-historic enthusiasts. With many fun features and useful tools. this powerful #1 bot for all of your dino needs!
It has the following features:

## How we built it

1.  Used HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap to create the homepage
2.  We used the Discord.js package to create a discord bot with Node.js
3. Used Google Cloud Platform's AutoML to implement the classification model
4. Uses 0Auth for authentication

6. Used Google Cloud Platform to deploy our hack

## Challenges we ran into

1. Couldn't integrate the AutoML with the bot
2. Getting our dataset was a long and tedious job
3. We had trouble limiting the search engine only to pre-historic facts
4. We were stuck with the deployment of our app

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. Happy to get our bot working and deployed
2. Created a homepage with a beautiful UI 
3. Implemented most of our features
 
## What we learned
1. Learned how to use GCP's tools and deployment
2. Used CockroachDB for the first time
